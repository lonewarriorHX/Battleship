before you play, you will be given 3 choices.you can select small size, which has 3x3 square box or medium size, with 5x5 square box. or large size , with 7x7 square and you can select the level, easy level, medium level or the hardest one.

in easy level the winning percentage is almost 100%, in hard level, the winning percentage is below 25%, so i suggest to take the medium level, so i suggest to take the medium level, Its a simple game, by the way. you can choose the coordinate to shot. if there was a ship, you hit it, but if there wasn't, you missed. the harder the level is, the less chance to guess. good luck. Have fun...
